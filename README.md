## ⚙️ How It Works

The app uses 5 pre-defined rules derived from financial ratios. Each rule votes either `BANKRUPT` or `NON BANKRUPT`. The final prediction is made based on **majority voting**.

| Rule | Logic | Prediction |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Debt/Equity ≤ 0.735 | NON BANKRUPT |
| 2 | ROE ≤ -0.245 | BANKRUPT |
| 3 | Gross Margin > 0.045 | NON BANKRUPT |
| 4 | Reinvestment Rate ≤ -0.425 | BANKRUPT |
| 5 | Assets/Equity in [1.825, 3.255] | NON BANKRUPT |
